CSS itself enough.

CSS Transitions allow you to perfom animation.

//Challenges in JUST CSS 

We can add anmations when it is in the DOM => When we remove it from the dom, it gest removed suddenly.
Acheivig styles for ceratin level is more complex.

For that we can use Framer Motion for react apps.


//For when element mounted to the DOM
transtition={{duration:0.3s, type="spring", bounce:0, stiffness:500, mass:100}}
animate={{x:45, y:23, rotate:90, opacity:1}}
initial={{x:0, y:30, opacity:0}}

//When Item removed from the DOM

exit={{x:45, opacity:1}}

AnimationPresence => Component should be wrapped inside where we want the motion animation. AnimationPresence looks
for the exit property before it is getting removed from the DOM.
